            <p>Some times I think about how in some ways nomatter what you do in some 
                ways, you will always be alone. The only consciousness that will ever
                reside within your head is you own. That scares me, maybe one day we 
                will all unite, become one, a single being, indivuality indecernable.</p>
            
            <p>My achievements feel hollow, meaningles, without reason or gain.</p>

            <p>I am at a restaurant right now with my family. One of my dads friends 
                are in town and they decided to meet at breakfast. Its very loud but 
                im doing ok, wish me luck.</p>

            <br>
            

            <p>I wasent always the nicest person. I think it came from insecurity, 
                I found a group I could fit in with and all I had to do was have 
                controversial opinions and be inconsiderate and cruel. I had finally 
                found a way out, a way to not be alone. Eventually they pushed me away,
                discarded. Those I orignally wronged, the people I fit in with didnt 
                forgive me. Its been years and many of the people I care about hate me.
                Its not their fault, Im not owed anything. I dont deserve second chance
                but in some ways I have been given one, I guess most of them have 
                forgiven me but the ones who havent cause the most hurt.</p>

            <p>I have one person who will invite me out to do things. Im thankful 
                but cant shake the feeling that he does it just to try to make me 
                feel better. I know these kind of thoughs are often irrational but
                hes done something like that before, and while I forgave him I still 
                fear that everything he does for me is fake and out of the want for
                me not kill myself.</p>

            <p>I hate the feeling of my problems being external. Sometimes things arent
                my fault, I hate it, sometimes you cant fix things, they will lie eternally
                broken, without purpose.</p>

            <p>Some times I get into dangerous thought pattenrs. Try to convince my self 
                that there is a reason. I start to think things that are unprovable,
                destructive, dangerous. But I cant shake the insanity. Maybe my purpose,
                the intention of me being here is to be this way, constantly drifting,
                alone.
            </p>

            <p>I struggle to commit to things, its not that Im losing intrest, its more
                that ive lost hope. I try new things, think they are cool, then get instantly
                discourged, afraid, I try think "will I ever be good at this?" or
                "how do I know this will make me happy?". I rarely come out of that 
                thought being motivated to continue.
            </p>
