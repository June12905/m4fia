            <p>Some times I think about how in some ways nomatter what you do in some 
                ways, you will always be alone. The only consciousness that will ever
                reside within your head is you own. That scares me, maybe one day we 
                will all unite, become one, a single being, indivuality indecernable.</p>
            
            <p>My achievements feel hollow, meaningles, without reason or gain.</p>

            <p>I am at a restaurant right now with my family. One of my dads friends 
                are in town and they decided to meet at breakfast. Its very loud but 
                im doing ok, wish me luck.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Monday, July 10, 2023</h3>
            <br>
            

            <p>I wasent always the nicest person. I think it came from insecurity, 
                I found a group I could fit in with and all I had to do was have 
                controversial opinions and be inconsiderate and cruel. I had finally 
                found a way out, a way to not be alone. Eventually they pushed me away,
                discarded. Those I orignally wronged, the people I fit in with didnt 
                forgive me. Its been years and many of the people I care about hate me.
                Its not their fault, Im not owed anything. I dont deserve second chance
                but in some ways I have been given one, I guess most of them have 
                forgiven me but the ones who havent cause the most hurt.</p>

            <p><del>I have one person who will invite me out to do things. Im thankful 
                but cant shake the feeling that he does it just to try to make me 
                feel better. I know these kind of thoughs are often irrational but
                hes done something like that before, and while I forgave him I still 
                fear that everything he does for me is fake and out of the want for
                me not kill myself.</del></p>

            <p>I hate the feeling of my problems being external. Sometimes things arent
                my fault, I hate it, sometimes you cant fix things, they will lie eternally
                broken, without purpose.</p>

            <p>Some times I get into dangerous thought pattenrs. Try to convince my self 
                that there is a reason. I start to think things that are unprovable,
                destructive, dangerous. But I cant shake the insanity. Maybe my purpose,
                the intention of me being here is to be this way, constantly drifting,
                alone.
            </p>

            <p>I struggle to commit to things, its not that Im losing intrest, its more
                that ive lost hope. I try new things, think they are cool, then get instantly
                discourged, afraid, I try think "will I ever be good at this?" or
                "how do I know this will make me happy?". I rarely come out of that 
                thought being motivated to continue.
            </p>

            <p>Im kinda losing the ability to figure out what im feeling. Recently I havent
                been crying as much, which is good but its been replaced with something
                strange. I know im feeling something alot of the time, sometimes I even act
                on those feelings, but I sometimes fail to recognize what they are, everythings
                just kinda... dull.
            </p>
            <p>I was thinking of getting a Commodore Amiga. There just seems to be so much
                cool software for the things!

            <br>

            <p>I woke up after a pretty good night of sleep. Im feeling pretty good today.
                Im going to a movie with some friends tonight, its a rerun of an old Studio
                Ghibli movie. I think it will be fun.
            </p>

            <p>Had fun at the movie.</p>

            <p>I think I might have gone a little insane for a few days. Im not sure exactly 
                what triggered it but I kind just lost it. Didnt sleep for nearly 72 hours.
            </p>
            
            <p>THE MUSIC CANT GET LOUD ENOUGH.</p>

            <br>

            <p>I dont know what to do.</p>

            <p>My thoughts keep wandering. I dont even really know whats wrong or why I feel
                so shitty. I feel alone right after hanging out or sometimes even when im 
                surronded by other people. I just cant escape, im trapped. I feel like im 
                locked in place, immovable, permanently lost. Any attempt that I make to meet
                new people or make friends just ends in embarrassment. 
            </p>

            <p>I cant do anything. I cant do my laundry, clean my room, eat. Everthing is
                extremely difficult and I dont know why.
            </p>

            <p>Sorry I didnt post yesterday, I was hanging out with my friend. A few days ago
                I made some new friends and they were really nice to me. Its something im not
                really used to, but people being really kind and interested in talking to me 
                and interested in my hobbies is a nice thing that I havent really experienced much in a while.

            <p>Sorry that I havent been exactly active, Ive been working on some other projects
                that I currently deem to be more important. Im sure this will get more attention
                in the near future but for now you can expect me to post here a few times a week
                but probably not every day. Much love.

            <p>Rage, I have been consumed. They do not care, humanity they strip. They inform those 
                that have been blinded of their ways. Those who do not know that there is nowhere 
                else.
